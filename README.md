# SmartMenus Sass

jQuery website menu plugin. Responsive and accessible list-based website menus that work on all devices.

Code originally from SmartMenus by Vadikom.
Check out [the demo page](http://vadikom.github.io/smartmenus/src/demo/).

This fork has been modified to support Sass for ease of front-end rapid development.
All the original js remain untouched, although minified.

## Folder setup

src sass and compontent are compiled into the following folders.

/src/_/components/js   -->  /src/_/js

/src/_/compontents/sass  -->  /src/_/css

For backport compatibility some original folder locations will remain the same.

 jquery.smartmenus.js location will remain in the /src/jquery.smartmenus.js.
 for now the css folder will remain the same as the upstream project.

 compiled css will be /src/_/css
